# Approx Redirector

This simple Python 3 script does redirect all entries in your `sources.list` and `sources.list.d` files to a given approx instance.
It redirects all entries cached by the approx server
but does not change uncached repositories.

## Repository clones

The original repository will be stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/Zocker1999NET/approx-redirect).
You can use the original reopsitory if you want to use GitHub.
Also issues and pull requests will be collected there for convenience.

This repository will be cloned to my own server.
You can use the [clone](https://git.banananet.work/zocker/approx-redirect) instead of this repository
if you want to avoid use GitHub.

## Features

- Looks up cacheable repositories
- Supports â‰ˆ99.9 % of all approx configurations out there (except approx forcing https)
- Verboses changes if requested
- Can rewrite sources files if run as `root`
- Does backup old sources files for easy restoring
- Supports mirror lists for allowing fallback to direct connection (see [`man apt-transport-mirror`](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/apt/apt-transport-mirror.1.en.html))
  (**WARNING**: This feature is not considered stable, please use with caution)

### ToDo

- Support https for approx

## Usage

- Obviously requires a Debian-based system
- Requires `python3` and `python3-request` to be installed

Assuming `approx` is the hostname of the approx cache you want to use.
You can use an IP address instead.
You can append a port by using `approx:9999`.
By default `http://` will be used
but you can specify https as protocol, too: `https://approx` (**not supported yet**).

```
./redirect.py -v approx
```

The script will check which entries can be redirected
and report these to stdout.
If you want to approve these changes, run as `root`:

```
./redirect.py -vc approx
```

Now your system will use the approx cache.
The old entries can be found in the backup files.

### Mirror Mode

To use mirror mode, follow the same approach as above,
but append the flag `-m` or `--mirror-mode` to the arguments.
